# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Hello!
In the project0 boundaries I've created site dedicated to France history. 

My webpage contains following html pages:
- index.html -> main page, it's nav bar is connected to others pages, index has responsive design to smaller screen, the structure is logo, navbar, <ol> and <ul>, table, grid, footer. All style properties are described in style.css
- news.html
- about.html
- history.html

For each of these files I've created scss file compiled to css and connected to appropriate html page:
- index.scss -> main css file with all styles form index.html, consists of styles for all components, responsive possibility, has selectors, nested, inheritance, before, after and hover features.
- news.scss
- about.scss
- history.scss
